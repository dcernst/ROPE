\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]

\item[A.] \textbf{PERSONNEL}

PI Ernst requests $0.5$ of one month's summer salary and the associated fringe benefits each year for 3 years. We have assumed a salary increase of 3\% per year.  During the funding period, the PI will work intensively on the specific tasks listed in the project description and other related items. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$10,927}

\item[B.] \textbf{OTHER PERSONNEL}

None. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$0}

\item[C.] \textbf{FRINGE BENEFITS}

Fringe benefits were calculated using NAU formulas for benefit rates for FY 2013 (15.6\%).

\hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$1,705}

\item[D.] \textbf{EQUIPMENT}

None. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$0}

\item[E.] \textbf{TRAVEL}

Travel funds are requested to allow the PI to attend national mathematics meetings to disseminate information about the OPL to allow for face-to-face team meetings.  Travel to the collaborative PIs' institutions is also anticipated for meetings with the Advisory Group and External Evaluator. In Years 2 and 3, funds are included to support undergraduate travel to the Joint Mathematical Meetings where they will have a demonstration of the OPL.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[] \textbf{Year 1:} The PI is requesting a total of \$5550.
\begin{itemize}
\item \$4300 for travel to both the Joint Mathematics Meetings and MathFest.
\item \$625 for travel for meeting Advisory Group and other co-PIs.
\item \$625 for travel for meeting with External Evaluator and other co-PIs.
\end{itemize}

\item[] \textbf{Year 2:} The PI is requesting a total of \$7550.
\begin{itemize}
\item \$4300 for travel to both the Joint Mathematics Meetings and MathFest.
\item \$625 for travel for meeting Advisory Group and other co-PIs.
\item \$625 for travel for meeting with External Evaluator and other co-PIs.
\item \$2000 for travel for two undergraduate students to Joint Mathematics Meetings.
\end{itemize}

\item[] \textbf{Year 3:} The PI is requesting a total of \$6330.
\begin{itemize}
\item \$4300 for travel to both the Joint Mathematics Meetings and MathFest.
\item \$2000 for travel for two undergraduate students to Joint Mathematics Meetings.
\end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}

\hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$19,400}

\item[F.] \textbf{PARTICIPANT SUPPORT COSTS}

None. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$0}

\item[G.] \textbf{OTHER DIRECT COSTS}

The total direct cost is the sum of summer salaries, fringe benefits, and travel for years 1--3. 

\hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$32,031}

\item[I.] \textbf{INDIRECT COSTS}

Indirect costs are calculated based on Northern Arizona University’s Colleges and Universities Rate Agreement, which stipulates an on-campus rate of 49\% MTDC, with exclusions for tuition, equipment, and subawards greater than \$25,000. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$15,695}

\item[J.] \textbf{TOTAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS}

This is the sum of items H and I. \hfill \fbox{\textbf{Total:} \$47,726}

\item[M.] \textbf{COST SHARING}

None. \hfill \fbox{Subtotal: \$0}
