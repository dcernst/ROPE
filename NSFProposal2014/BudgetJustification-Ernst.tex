\item[E.] \textbf{TRAVEL}

Travel funds are requested to allow the PI to attend national mathematics meetings to disseminate information about ROPE to allow for face-to-face team meetings.  Travel to the collaborative PIs' institutions is also planned for meetings with the Advisory Group and External Evaluator. In Year 3, funds are included to support undergraduate travel to the Joint Mathematical Meetings where they will have a demonstration of ROPE and help staff our booth in the exhibit area at the JMM.
