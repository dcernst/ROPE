The proposed project will develop an online, electronic library, the
Resource of Open Problems for Education (ROPE), that will provide many
innovative, well-tested, and documented problems that mathematics
instructors and students can use in a wide range of courses and assignment
types.  Any user will be able to search this library for problems by
course, topic, type of problem (e.g., numerical, symbolic, etc.), level of
difficulty, and other characteristics; and by keyword or problem text.
Problems will be contributed by the community of users and will have
associated descriptive information that will include user feedback and
comments, as well as statistics on the frequency of the problem's use.
Users will be able to comment on and rate problems, and flag them using a
commonly understood "endorse" feature (similar to those used on social
networking sites).  They will also be able to create and share collections
of problems, and collections of these collections, they may refer to later
for specific assignments (homework, quizzes, worksheets, etc.) or to
describe problems sets for entire courses.  The library will support
different problem formats (e.g., LaTeX or Word) and the ability to
translate between them, and will be able to interact with other
applications (for example, online homework systems) to provide problems
for them.
