The Resource of Open Problems for Education (ROPE) will be an easy-to-use,
high-quality resource that provides something that teachers and learners
of mathematics need: a source of problems to evaluate and promote
learning.  Its broad impact will stem from its ability to be such a
resource for a wide range of users, from students looking for sample 
problems to study from to mathematics instructors creating entire IBL 
courses.  The PIs have extensive and varied contacts with faculty in a
large number of institutions and communities of faculty, including Project
NExT, those interested in inquiry-based learning, and open-content
authors, which will allow for effective dissemination to those groups most
likely to use the resource.  We therefore expect that ROPE will have broad
impact, reaching instructors at all types of colleges and universities who
are teaching any standard mathematics course in any of a number of
different ways.  We further expect that as ROPE develops we will be able
to extend it to include other disciplines, though that is not a goal of
this proposal.
